Categorized Inventory for Gothic 2 NotR
=======================================

This patch extends the inventory by browsable categories.


Additional Keys Strokes
-----------------------

SHIFT + [left/right]    Switch between categories
[Choose Weapon]         Quick-switch between player and container/trading inventory
HOME                    Quick-jump to first item
END                     Quick-jump to last item
SHIFT + HOME            Quick-switch to first category
SHIFT + END             Quick-switch to last category


INI Settings
------------

The categorized inventory can be adjusted with three settings in the Gothic.ini in the section [GAME].

 1. The categories and their order can be set with "invCatOrder".
 2. The setting "invCatChangeOnLast" (0 or 1) changes whether navigation beyond the last/first column should switch the
    category instead of moving the selection to the previous/next line.
 3. With "invCatG1Mode" (0 or 1) the 'all' category is removed and all non-player inventories do not have categories.


Notes
-----

Patch includes CatInv.
