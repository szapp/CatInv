Categorized Inventory for Gothic 2 NotR
=======================================

This patch extends the inventory by browsable categories.


Additional Keys Strokes
-----------------------

SHIFT + [left/right]    Switch between categories
[Choose Weapon]         Quick-switch between player and container/trading inventory
HOME                    Quick-jump to first item
END                     Quick-jump to last item
SHIFT + HOME            Quick-switch to first category
SHIFT + END             Quick-switch to last category


Categories
-------------

The categories and their order can be set in the Gothic.ini with the setting invCatOrder in the section [GAME]. The
setting invCatChangeOnLast (0 or 1) changes whether navigation beyond the last/first column should switch the category
instead of moving the selection to the previous/next line.



Patch includes CatInv.
